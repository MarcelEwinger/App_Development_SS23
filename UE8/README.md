# 3 Jetpack Navigation

Jetpack Navigation is a powerful framework provided by Google that simplifies seam-
less app navigation in Android development. By utilizing navigation graphs, desti-
nations, actions, and deep linking, developers can create intuitive and user-friendly
navigation flows. In this exercise, you will implement a simple app using Jetpack
Navigation, following the provided requirements:

```
□ The app should consist of three destinations:
```
```
□ Home screen: Displays a list of items (be creative about the type of items)
□ Detail screen: Shows more specific details of a selected item
□ Edit screen: Allows rudimental editing of these details
```
```
□ Define appropriate actions to navigate between these destinations.
```
```
□ Use Safe Args to pass data securely.
```
```
□ Additionally, implement transition effects for the navigation to enhance the
user experience.
```
```
□ For more information on Jetpack Navigation, refer to the official documenta-
tion: https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation

# 4 Date- and Timepicker Dialog

Date- and Timepicker dialogs are very useful controls to get valid timing information
from the user.

□ Scour the internet for examples that show different characteristics of date- and
timepickers.
```
```
□ Describe the advantages and disadvantages for selected examples and different
use cases.
```
```
